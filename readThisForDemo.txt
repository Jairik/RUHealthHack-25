notes for running test build:

backend (run in root directory):
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python -m uvicorn app:app

frontend (MAKE SURE TO CD INTO FRONTEND FIRST):
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

note: run backend (root terminal) and frontend (cd'ed into frontend) in separate terminal windows
another note: i redid the database schema to work with SQLite instead of AWS Aurora (for demo purposes)
third note: i added the ability to remove a triage case from the dashboard, this is conveneient for testing and real-world use

JJ:
Helper bash scripts can also be used to make it a little bit easier
-------------------------------------------------
Full application: bash runDemo.sh
-------------------------------------------------
For debugging puposes:
    Frontend only: bash runFrontend.sh
    Backend only: bash runBackend.sh
