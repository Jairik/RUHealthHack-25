notes for running test build:

backend:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python -m uvicorn app:app

frontend:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

note: run backend and frontend in separate terminal windows
another note: i redid the database schema to work with SQLite instead of AWS Aurora (for demo purposes)
third note: i added the ability to remove a triage case from the dashboard, this is conveneient for testing and real-world use
